# AutoGrow

## Summary:
AutoVeg is a customizable indoor veggie garden that you can fully automate. Using IOT - RaspberryPI, and built on the Open Source MudPi, the system is intended to bring growing amazing vegetables to any climate, with as little upkeep as you decide to make it. 

For this first round (beginning Sept 2020), it will be based purely on the MudPi system of outdoor garden automation: https://mudpi.app. 

However the main difference will be that it is indoors, using LED grow lights, in a grow tent to maximize light availability for the plants. 

## Plan for First Iteration: 
Using the open source plans for MudPi, this first version of the AutoVeg will grow simple vegetables that are generally easy to grow. For now these will be the herb Lemon Balm (Melissa officinalis) and Kale (Brassica oleracea) for both nutritional value and ease of growth. As space allows, other herbs or veggies may be grown as well. 

## Requirements: 
### Ease of Use: 
The system, when fully built, should be easily modularized and expandable for more complex growing conditions and requirements in order to optimize the health and productivity of the plants. 
There will be no (few) electricians required - only standard plugs and electrical systems when fully built. 
The parts must be purchasable from any standard hardware store. 
Growth optimized for vegetables (to be researched)
Light spectrum (LED lights will be used)
Temperature (for now ambient room temperature (15-25C)
Air Flow
Soil pH and nutrition
Moisture levels in soil
### Expandable from basic (light and water controls) to elaborate (see list above).
Contain a database of plant-specific desired growing conditions - from tomatoes and peppers (warm) to kale and chard (cool), the system will allow you to select which plants you have, and will automatically detect which components you have to determine the level of control and automation the system can use.
